# cmake-noweb
CMake and the noweb literate programming tool template.

This is a barebones example that integrates noweb and cmake.

To get started clone this repository and run cmake && make from the root of the source you just checked out.

This will create main.c and main.h files inside src/ and will create an executable quant inside the src directory.

If you want more files add more to the sets in CMakeLists.txt.
